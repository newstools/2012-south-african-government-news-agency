Pretoria - The Department of Labour has launched a dedicated hotline to help fight fraud and corruption. Members of the public, government employees and suppliers of goods and/or services who suspect fraud and corruption are now able to inform the department on 08600 22 194, or via e-mail at Fraud@labour.gov.za or fax on 012 309 4676. The launch of the hotline on Friday was in response to the requirements of the Whistleblowing Policy and in line with department Director General Nkosinathi Nhleko's objective to help intensify the focus on efforts designed to reposition the department's institution for a better response to service delivery, as well as ensuring accessibility of service delivery points. Those who use the hotline to report illegal activities will be able to do so anonymously, in line with the  Protected Disclosure Act. "The Protected Disclosures Act provides protection for employees in both private and public sector when disclosing information regarding unlawful or irregular conduct by their employers or other employees without the fear of suffering an occupational loss/harm," said the department. It promised on average a turnover time of 30 days to resolve matters reported. However, testing the credibility of information would be key in ensuring the success of the anti-fraud and corruption campaign. Every matter would be treated on its merit. - SAnews.gov.za
