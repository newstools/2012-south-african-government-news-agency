The talks, according to Zuma's office, are held under the auspices of the SADC Troika on Politics, Defence and Security, by member states Zambia and Tanzania. South Africa is the chair of the Troika. In June, the SADC Summit held in Angola, had called on the Organ Troika to facilitate an urgent meeting between Marc Ravalomanana and Andry Rajoelina to discuss the full implementation of the roadmap that was signed by the political parties in September last year. President Zuma is accompanied by the Minister of State Security Siyabonga Cwele and Deputy Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Marius Fransman. The Indian Ocean island has been mired in political crisis since Rajoelina ousted Ravalomanana in March 2009 with the army's backing.
