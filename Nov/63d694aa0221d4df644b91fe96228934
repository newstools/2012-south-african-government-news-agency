Pretoria - The Department of Correctional Services is conducting an investigation into the circumstances that led to an attempted prison escape by three awaiting trial inmates at the C-Max Prison in Pretoria on Wednesday morning. According to the department's spokesperson, Phumlani Ximiya, the three awaiting trial inmates were at an exercise yard when they attempted to escape. They were reportedly not in shackles as is the norm. "Our investigation will focus on who unchained them and why," said Ximiya. Bongani Moyo, Khumbulani Sibanda and Leon Dube are awaiting trial on counts of armed robbery with aggravating circumstances and possession of unlicensed firearms. In their attempt to escape, they got injured and were rearrested by Correctional Services officials. They were treated for head, leg, neck and facial injuries. Their attempt to escape was foiled after they were spotted by a newspaper vendor who saw them jumping from the roof of a double-storey building and climbing the prison fence. Yesterday would have been Moyo's third escape from custody. In his last escape, he simply walked out of the Pretoria Magistrate's Court. He was then rearrested in Hillbrow. Ximiya told BuaNews that disciplinary action would be taken against officials who are found to have assisted the three. "So far, no officials have been suspended but investigations are continuing," Ximiya said.
