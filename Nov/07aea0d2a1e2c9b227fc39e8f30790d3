Pretoria - Students and lecturers at the University of Venda (Univen) will get to enjoy new facilities as the institution today opened new buildings at their main campus. The new buildings include, among others, the life sciences building; student administration building; new lecture theatre complex; extension to the school of environmental sciences and the refurbishment of the library. Speaking at the opening, Deputy President and Chancellor Kgalema Motlanthe said the University of Venda was well on its way to fulfilling its commitment to being a quality driven and financially sustainable, comprehensive university. He acknowledged that the road ahead would present many opportunities, but as expected there would be challenges and obstacles. "To succeed we are required to be more innovative, constantly looking at new ways of doing things, correctly and better. We also require the ability to work harder and smarter, and more importantly, to work collaboratively as a team, united in our purpose of steering our university ever further in our quest for excellence," said Motlanthe. Motlanthe took over the Chancellor of the university from Cyril Ramaphosa in March 2010.
