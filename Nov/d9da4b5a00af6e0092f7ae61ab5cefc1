The holy month of Ramadaan is the period in which Muslims are ordered to fast and abstain completely from food and drink from before the sun rises until after sunset. It is an important form of worship that increases within the individual his or her bond with the Almighty Creator and also increases their consciousness of their duty towards worship. Zuma said as the Muslim citizens of South Africa join fellow worshipers across the globe in fasting and worship, he was certain that the important objectives of this holy month would be met. "May I therefore, on behalf of Government and the people of South Africa, take this opportunity to wish all Muslims well over Ramadaan, and I am confident that the important lessons of this period will help South African Muslims in continuing their positive contribution to this beautiful country." Fasting teaches patience and dedication, at the same time, it also enables one to feel and understand the plight of the poverty stricken.
