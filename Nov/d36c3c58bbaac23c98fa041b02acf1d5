Pretoria - An independent team of accident investigation and reconstruction specialists is helping in the culpable homicide probe after 12 Malawian nationals died in a road crash in Limpopo. The bus accident happened on the N1 near Louis Trichardt this morning, leaving 12 dead and 49 injured. Media reports say the bus overturned when the driver allegedly lost control of the vehicle when the brakes failed. The bus was travelling from Malawi, but it is still unclear where it was bound. "We want to convey condolences to the families of those killed in this tragic road crash, and wish those injured a speedy recovery. Our thoughts and prayers are with them all during these difficult moments," said Transport Minister Sibusiso Ndebele. "We are pleading with everyone to take personally the fight against deaths on our roads and to work together to bring down road deaths during this global Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011-2020."
