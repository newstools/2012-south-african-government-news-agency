Pretoria - Jacob Humphreys has been found guilty of murdering 10 schoolchildren who were killed when his minibus was hit by a train at a level crossing in Blackheath outside Cape Town last year. On Monday, Western Cape High Court Judge Robert Henney found Humphreys guilty on 10 charges of murder and four of attempted murder. He faced 10 charges of murder, or alternatively manslaughter, as well as four of attempted murder, or assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm. The taxi driver was transporting children to school in a taxi on 25 August last year when he overtook a row of cars and ignored safety signals at the Buttskop level crossing in Blackheath. Humphreys will be sentenced next year in February. Provincial Transport MEC, Robin Carlisle, has described the judgement as a victory for justice, for road safety, for the entire country. He said the judgement comes at a time when the National Prosecuting Authority was taking a firmer approach when it came to those who disobeyed the rules of the road. "The National Prosecuting Authority must take full credit for having the courage and determination to forge ahead with murder charges,"
