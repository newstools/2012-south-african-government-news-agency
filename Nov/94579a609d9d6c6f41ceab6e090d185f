Pretoria-President Jacob Zuma has extended his warm wishes to all South African mothers to have a wonderful Mothers Day. "Mothers are the pillars of our society; they are the rock upon which families are founded. They are the thread that holds our communities and our nation together. "Today is the day to demonstrate love and respect to all our mothers and confirm that we know and treasure the pivotal role they play in our lives and in our country. Happy Mother's Day to all South African women. "We must treasure mothers and women in our society and acknowledge their valuable contribution not only in the home environment, but in the public space and in the reconstruction and development of our country," he said. The President will celebrate Mothers Day in Durban at the ceremony of the unveiling of the tombstone of Queen Thomozile, mother of King Goodwill Zwelithini, a demonstration of the importance of honouring women and mothers and to acknowledge their role in history and heritage.
