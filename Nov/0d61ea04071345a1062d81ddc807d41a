Pretoria - Former President Nelson Mandela has been discharged from hospital following his admission yesterday. "The doctors have decided to send him home as the diagnostic procedure he underwent did not indicate anything seriously wrong with him," said the Presidency in a statement on Sunday. Earlier, President Jacob Zuma said Madiba was making good progress. "He is surrounded by his family and is relaxed and comfortable. The doctors are happy with the progress he is making. "We thank all South Africans for their love and support of Madiba. We also thank all for affording Madiba and his family privacy and dignity," said Zuma. Mandela underwent a diagnostic laparoscopy yesterday to determine the cause of his longstanding abdominal complaint. "The doctors have assured us that there is nothing to worry about and that Madiba is in good health", said Zuma.
