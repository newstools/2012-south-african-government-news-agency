Pretoria - The Judicial Service Commission (JSC) has appealed to suitably qualified candidates to make themselves available for positions on the bench. The JSC said it remained concerned about the number of competent and appropriately qualified candidates who were making themselves available to be considered for appointment to the bench. "For instance, the JSC could only shortlist five candidates for the six vacancies in the North and South Gauteng High Court. Of the five shortlisted candidates, only three were recommended for appointment to the President. "The JSC urges competent and appropriately qualified candidates to consider making themselves available so as to contribute in building a judiciary that all South Africans would be proud of," it said. On Tuesday the JSC announced the candidates it recommended to President Jacob Zuma for vacant positions on the bench. For the two vacancies in the Supreme Court of Appeals, Justice Xola Mlungisi Petse and  Justice Ronnie Pillay were recommended. The JSC recommended Duncan Zolani Dukada as a judge of the Eastern Cape High Court; Bulelwa Myra Pakati as a judge of the Northern Cape High Court; and Advocate Selby Alan Masibonge Baqwa SC, Elizabeth Mamoloko Kubushi and Advocate Bashier Vally SC, as judges of the North and South Gauteng High Court. The JSC also recommended that the President appoint Judge President of the Labour Court Dunstan Mlambo as Judge President of the North and South Gauteng High Court. This appointment will take effect on 1 November 2012 when Judge President Ngoepe retires from active service. No candidates were recommended for the KZN Deputy Judge President vacancy, this and other vacancies will be re-advertised.
