Pretoria - South African Football Association (Safa) President Kirsten Nematandani has poured accolades on the late Bafana Bafana coach, April "Styles" Phumo. The Lesotho-born Phumo, 74, succumbed to cancer on Sunday morning. "Phumo was one of the best coaches ever to set foot in this country, and was a great educator, very passionate about the game. At his age he was still active in coaching, and he will be dearly missed. "As Safa, we are mourning the passing away of the former Bafana coach. This is a difficult time for his family and friends, and as the association we would like to convey our heartfelt condolences to all of them at this hour of need. "The sport has lost a great gentleman and an asset. May his soul rest in peace," he said. Bra Styles, as he was commonly known, was the first coach of the senior men's national team of his native country before moving to South Africa, where he started his coaching career with Bloemfontein Celtic. He also coached Ria Stars, the South African under 20 and 23 Men's national teams. He also had a stint with Banyana Banyana. In 2002, he was in charge of Bafana Bafana at the Africa Cup of Nations tournament in Tunisia. He then became assistant to head Coach Trott Moloto in the following edition of the competition in Nigeria in 2002. He also coached National First Division side United FC, before moving to Atlie FC in the same division. Funeral arrangements are still being organised.
