Pretoria - Cabinet has moved the official celebration of Africa Public Service Day to Friday, 22 June. The Pan African Conference of Ministers in 2001, declared 23 June as Africa Public Service Day. However, this year the 23rd of June would be on a Saturday. Africa Public Service Day is an annual event in which all African countries share best practices, challenges and progress in respect of transformation programmes. According to Minister in the Presidency for Performance Monitoring and Evaluation Collins Chabane, Public Service and Administration Minister Lindiwe Sisulu will lead the roundtable discussion to mark the day. Chabane said events on the day will also initiate the rollout of the 15 years of the Batho Pele campaign which will in turn culminate in Africa Public Service Week in September. "Cabinet commends public servants for the good work done and challenges the public service cadre to come up with new initiatives and innovations to obtain feedback from citizens on services rendered as part of ensuring that we are a truly responsive government committed to meeting the basic needs for the public," he said.
