Pretoria - With less than 14 day to the closing date for entries to be added to the 7 Wonders of the World, Cabinet has urged South Africans to cast their vote for Table Mountain. Table Mountain is one of only two African nominees. There are 28 worldwide competing for the title of one of the Wonders of the World, including the Dead Sea, the Amazon, the Great Barrier Reef and the Black Forest. Briefing media today, Cabinet spokesperson Jimmy Manyi encouraged people to SMS their vote to 34874 (each SMS costs R2) or vote online on the website www.votefortable mountain.com. Cabinet also congratulated Cape Town for winning the World Design Capital for 2014 - beating rivals Dublin in Ireland and Bilbao in Spain. The title will see Cape Town host a number of prestigious design-related events and conferences organised by the World Design Capital initiative and the local committee. Manyi said the awards would improve South Africa's competitiveness for tourism and investment.
