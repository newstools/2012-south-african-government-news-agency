From October 2010 to October 2011, 15 051 565 vehicles and drivers were checked, 6 287 308 fines issued for various traffic offences, 21 575 drunk drivers arrested and 60 313 un-roadworthy vehicles discontinued from use, as part of the new National Rolling Enforcement Plan (NREP) and million-a-month vehicle check announced by Transport Minister Sibusiso Ndebele on 10 September 2010. Over the past two months (September and October 2011), more than 2 600 public transport drivers have been arrested as part of the pre-December holiday traffic law enforcement operations and following Minister Ndebele's instruction that every bus and taxi must be stopped and checked. Ndebele said law enforcement and emergency services officials will be out in full force to ensure safe roads, as we head towards Cop17 and the December holidays. "For law-abiding road users, these knights in shining armour, will be out there to ensure that you reach your destination safely. For those who blatantly disregard road rules, you will be arrested, detained in police cells, sentenced to a hefty fine or imprisonment and your driving licence will be cancelled or suspended," he said. Ndebele said drivers involved in fatal road crashes would face charges of murder or culpable homicide. "Let us celebrate the festive season by appreciating the most precious gift that we have all been given, the gift of life. "Let us all become Friends of the Decade of Action for Road Safety. Let us drive to save lives, and end death on our roads. Report road traffic offences to 0861 400 800," said the minister.
