Pretoria - The daughter of Public Works Minister Thulas Nxesi passed away in a car accident on Monday, the department said on Tuesday. The 17-year-old, Lona Nxesi, was involved in a car accident on her way home from a boarding school in Bloemfontein. Nxesi was appointed to his current position last year by President Jacob Zuma after the then Public Works Minister Gwen Mahlangu-Nkabinde was relieved of her duties. Funeral arrangements will be announced in due course.
