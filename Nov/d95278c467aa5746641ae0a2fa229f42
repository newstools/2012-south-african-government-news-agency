Polokwane - The newly elected Mayor of the Vhembe District Municipality in Limpopo, Tshitereke Matibe, has pledged to work around the clock to address the water shortages in poor communities. In his acceptance speech on Tuesday afternoon, Matibe said: "We must urgently convene a district water summit to specifically check the capacity of our (water) sources, state of water infrastructure and developing better options of delivering water to our communities." Matibe said the council must be strengthened and capacitated to ensure that councillors play their over-sight role without fear or favour. "This house must continuously monitor the implementation of the five key performance areas of our district which are; municipal transformation and organisational development, basic service delivery, local economic development, municipal financial viability and management and good governance and public participation." Matibe also invited traditional leaders to partner with the municipality to develop impoverished rural communities. "Without you, our developmental goals will never be realised. The collective leadership will always be ready to listen and engage you," he said. Matibe, a former mayor for Mutale municipality and the newly elected chairperson of ANC in the Vhembe region takes over from Florence Radzilani who is now Limpopo's MEC for Safety, Security and Liaison.
