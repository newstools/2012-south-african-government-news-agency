Pretoria - Two Rustenburg police constables became the latest police officials to find themselves in the line of fire this week when they were shot and injured while responding to a complaint. The two were on their way to Photsaneng village to investigate a house robbery, accompanied by the complainant, when they were ambushed early Tuesday morning. According to North West police, they were travelling in a police vehicle and noticed two vehicles parked alongside the road. As the police officials approached the vehicles, the occupants opened fire on them. "One of the police officials sustained serious bullet wounds on the chin, mouth and her forehead. It is suspected that a bullet went through her chin and protruded through the forehead. The suspects were allegedly using rifles during the attack," police said. The other constable was shot in the knee, while the complainant was also injured in the attack. Police are still searching for the suspects and the motive for the attack is unknown. The attack on the constables came just a day after a police captain was killed and the station commander seriously injured during a shooting incident at the Rosebank police station in Johannesburg. Lieutenant-Colonel Thandi Mkhize was wounded and Captain Neelavathie Naidu shot dead by a clerk at the police station. According to reports, the clerk had been found guilty of mishandling firearms and was about to be dismissed. After opening fire on the women, the clerk shot himself. Mkhize, who was shot multiple times, is reportedly in a serious condition in hospital.
