Pretoria - Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga has condemned the continuing violence in the Grabouw area of the Western Cape, following the burning of Umyezo wama Apile School. Angry protesters burnt down the school last week, demanding additional facilities and an end to overcrowding. Motshekga said it was unfortunate that residents were misled into believing that government could immediately eradicate the legacy of uninhabitable buildings, lack of resources and overcrowding in schools. She stressed, however, that the department was working very hard to deal with the situation at that school. "My colleague, Western Cape Education MEC Donald Grant has already identified a location for a new school in the area. I therefore find it unfortunate for residents to vandalise school property and intimidate learners," said Motshekga. Motshekga also denied reports that the disruption of schooling in Grabouw was politically motivated, noting that the national department fully supported efforts already made by the Western Cape Education Department to make means to ensure that learners attended school. She said at the moment, the most important thing was restoring normalcy in the school.
