Pretoria - The family of murdered schoolgirl Masego Kgomo believes justice has been served after her murderer was sentenced to life imprisonment on Tuesday. Brian Mangwale, who was earlier found guilty of Masego's murder, was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder and six years for kidnapping by the Pretoria High Court. Masego was murdered two years ago. The 10-year-old's badly decomposed and mutilated body was found in a field in Soshanguwe. Family spokesperson and CEO of the Masego Kgomo Foundation, Reverend Meshack Nkabinde, said Masego's family was happy with the sentence. "They believe justice has been done and are relieved because this person did not belong in society. While they are happy, they are also concerned because his accomplices are still out there." Although Mangwale's sentencing would go some way in helping the family find closure, the family would only be able to move on once everyone involved in Masego's death were brought to book, Nkabinde added. A memorial park is being set up in honour of the 10-year-old's life. It is being built at the site where Masego's body was found. On Saturday, Minister for Women, Children and People with Disabilities, Lulu Xingwana, participated in a sod-turning ceremony at the memorial park, where she called on the courts to impose harsh sentences on child killers.
