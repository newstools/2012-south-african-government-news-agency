Bloemfontein - Thousands of people - young and old - have filled the Callie Human Centre at the University of the Free State (UFS) to welcome "the daughter of the soil." This is how the university refers to Oprah Winfrey on a banner especially made to welcome the talk show queen on Friday, where she will be receiving an honorary doctorate in education. The mix of the crowd gathered to witness the conferring of the degree which is a definite indication of the followers she has managed to draw over the years. Where the audience on her now-concluded talk show represented people from all walks of life, the same could be seen at UFS, where slowly but surely the hall filled with scores of people all drawn to the woman who has commanded the attention of millions through the power of her words and actions. Snaking queues of eager guests were given a distinctively African welcoming, as a school marimba band belted out traditional rhythms in the foyer of Callie Human Centre. Just a few steps outside, locals took turns to get their picture taken with the media icon. As guests chattered enthusiastically among themselves while waiting for Miss Winfrey, one could definitely feel the build up of that vibe South Africans are famous for - just enough to say "Welcome! Wamkelekile!"
