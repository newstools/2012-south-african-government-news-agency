Johannesburg - It's official - Sports Minister Fikile Mbalula will participate in this year's Momentum 94.7 Cycle Challenge to be held on Sunday, 18 November. Mbalula received his cycling gear and race number 26318 from Primedia Broadcasting group head of news and talk programming, Yusuf Abramjee and Momentum Head of Brand, Danie van den Bergh, at Primedia Place in Sandton on Friday. Speaking after receiving his gear, the minister urged all South Africans to consider participating in cycling as part of promoting a healthy lifestyle. "Cycling is great, so we are encouraging everyone... to participate in cycling. Through cycling, people can fight diseases such as hypertension and diabetes," he said. Mbalula, who committed to finishing the cycling race in three hours, said he will not be competing to win. "I will not be competing to win the race, but to raise money for my own foundation so that we can use the money we raise to fund the educational needs of poor girls." Mbalula said every morning he cycled about 20 km. "It is pity that for security purposes, I cannot reveal my route. The only time I don't cycle is when I am outside the country." Upon receiving his race number, Mbalula jokingly said: "I would have like to get 46668 as my racing number. Van den Bergh said entries for the cycle challenge would open in May. The entry price is R299, while the timing chip price is R110, which is compulsory for an official result for the race. All route information is still being finalised and will be made available online in May. Race numbers will be collected at the Sandton Convention Centre three days before the race.
