Pretoria - With schools closing for winter holidays on Friday, the Limpopo Department of Health and Social Development is set to roll out a massive medical male circumcision (MMC) programme next week. MMC forms part of government's comprehensive HIV prevention strategy. Circumcision has been shown to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV transmission by as much as 60 percent. Limpopo Health and Social Development MEC Dikeledi Magadzi urged people to take advantage of the campaign. "All our hospitals in the province are open to conduct [MMC] at no cost. People who want to be circumcised at our hospitals must book their space in time to avoid disappointment as the need for this service might exceed expectation," said Magadzi, noting that 250 people are already in line to be circumcised at Tshilidzini Hospital. Magadzi assured that qualifying health workers, including those who are specifically trained to conduct circumcision, will be on high alert to assist at initiation schools throughout the province. "We are working closely with our traditional leaders and we remain confident that things will go well at initiation schools, including meeting all the necessary requirements." Meanwhile, Magadzi will on Sunday lead a campaign in the fight against drug and substance abuse as part of the International Day against Substance Abuse & Illicit Drug Trafficking. During the meeting with community members and stakeholders, Magadzi will deliver a keynote address which is expected to address issues relating access to drugs; the dangers of drug, alcohol and substance abuse and its impact on development. "The abuse of drugs, alcohol and substances has a negative impact on the fabric of our society. We therefore need to do something urgently before our people become addicts. We need to act against it with the same vigor we employed during the liberation struggle," Magadzi said on Thursday. The event will be held at Mutale town hall.
