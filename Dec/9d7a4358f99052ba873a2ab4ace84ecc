Pretoria - About 60 youngsters in Winburg have been identified to take part in the Free State Youth@Work programme aimed at youth empowerment. The programme aims to meet government's objectives for youth development through various integrated programmes that target training and skills development towards employment. It will be launched on Saturday by Free State Ministry for Cooperative Governance, Traditional Affairs and Human Settlements. Provincial Cooperative Governance, Traditional Affairs and Human Settlements MEC Mamiki Qabathe said the youth will be trained in construction and given an opportunity to work in some of the construction projects targeted at building houses for the women who participated in the 1956 Women's March against pass laws. "In addition, 50 youth who are on parole will assist with building the houses, the objective of their inclusion is to give them a chance for reintegration into the community through contribution to the wellbeing of others and also aims at creating a conscientious youth that will carry on the spirit of bringing about change, a youth that is socially conscious and makes a difference in the lives of others while getting skills and employment," said Qabathe. The National Youth Development Agency including the Department of Trade and Industry and the Free State Department of Social Development will participate in the programme towards an integrated approach of government in creating development opportunities for the youth. The event will be held in Makeleketla in Winburg, while the next event of a similar purpose will be held in Rouxville as it unfolds throughout the province in a phased manner.
