Pretoria - The police and Crime Line have appealed for the public's help in tracking down an East Rand man whose ex-girlfriend has gone missing. Police are searching for 30-year-old Zwelibanzi Kidwell Zungu. His last known address is Vosloorus, Extension 3 on the East Rand. "We are appealing to the community to help us find him. We believe he can help us in the investigation," said Gauteng police spokesman Brigadier Neville Malila. Zungu's ex-girlfriend, 27-year-old Nandi Mbizane, went missing from her home in Centurion in March and was last seen in the presence of her former and current boyfriends. Both men were arrested in connection with her disappearance, but were later released. A friend reported Mbizane missing after she failed to answer her phone and did not show up for work. Her flat was found in disarray and police reportedly found blood on the scene. Mbizane's current boyfriend told her friend that he had been assaulted by Zungu and subsequently opened a case against him. Fingerprints found on the scene also showed that Zungu spent the day at Mbizane's residential complex in Centurion. "He [Zungu] could provide information that may assist in this investigation and ultimately lead to police finding her. ... Do the right thing and help the police. You can pass on the information anonymously - we don't need to know who you are - just help us find him," said head of Crime Line Yusuf Abramjee. The public can pass on information regarding Zungu's whereabouts to Crime Line's SMS number - 32211 - or by contacting Crime Stop on 08600 10111.
