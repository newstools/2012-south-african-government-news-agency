Pretoria - Residents in Diepsloot, north of Johannesburg, are still prohibited from using tap water. Tests conducted by Johannesburg Water on Friday and Saturday showed that the water was clear and had no signs of contamination. However, the city is waiting for results from tests conducted on Sunday to confirm the safety of the area's drinking water. Last week, residents were advised not to use the water until the testing process had been conducted. In the meantime, residents have been advised to use mobile water tankers stationed in extension 2 and 7. Spokesperson for the City of Johannesburg, Millicent Kgowedi, confirmed to BuaNews that the restriction on the use of tap water was still in place. "Yesterday we conducted tests in the area and we are still waiting for the results. We conducted many tests because we wanted to be sure that the water is not contaminated."
