Pretoria - The Department of Trade and Industry (dti) has expressed disappointment that the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (Sascoc) has decided to import the National Olympic team's kit. Sascoc unveiled the kit last week. "The dti therefore wishes to register its profound disappointment that the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee has decided to procure our National Team kits for the Olympics to be held in London later this year, from imports. "This is despite competitive capabilities available amongst domestic manufacturers and represents a lost opportunity in terms of domestic sales and jobs," said the department. The country's textiles, clothing, leather and footwear sectors are showing positive signs of recovery with stability returning, noted the dti on Wednesday. This was due to collective efforts by all stakeholders including retailers, manufacturers, organised labour as well as government to raise the capabilities and competitiveness of the industry. Since 2009 the dti's Clothing and Textiles Competitiveness Programme has supported intensive upgrading of the industry. "Through these programmes the local manufacturers are becoming globally competitive and are steadily regaining the local retail market share which was lost to the Far East imports before 2009," said the department, adding that local manufacturers require the support of all local procurement agents so that they can build the economies of scale needed to grow and create jobs in these labour intensive sector. The London Olympic Games will take place from 27 July to 12 August followed by the Paralympic Games to be held from 29 August to 9 September 2012.
