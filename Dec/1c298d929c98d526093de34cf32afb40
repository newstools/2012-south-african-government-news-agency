Pretoria- The Department of Transport says it has noted the judgment handed down by the North Gauteng High Court regarding the implementation of e-tolling on the Gauteng Freeway Improvement Project road network. On Saturday, the North Gauteng High Court granted an urgent interdict against e-tolling, placing the project on hold until a full review can take place. The system would have kicked off on 30 April. The matter was brought to the High Court by the Opposition to Urban Tolling Alliance (Outa), South African Vehicle Renting and Leasing Association, the Quadpara Association of South Africa and the South African National Consumer Union. "We respect the decision. We will study the ruling thoroughly and decide on the next course of action," the department said in a statement.
