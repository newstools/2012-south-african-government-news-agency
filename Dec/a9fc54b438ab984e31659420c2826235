Pretoria - Sport and Recreation Minister Fikile Mbalula will be rolling out the South African School Sport National Championships from 10 -15 December at various venues in Tshwane. The SA School Sport National Championships is the culmination of the minister' sports plan, which seeks to ensure maximum access to sport, recreation and physical education in every school in South Africa. A Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the Ministry of Sport & Recreation and Basic Education on 13 December 2011, wherein both departments had an agreement on specific roles to play regarding the programme. This was preceded by the School Sport programme, which was launched on 5 November 2011 at Vista, Soweto, followed by the signing of the MoU. The MoU commits both departments to deliver a sustainable integrated plan to provide school children with opportunities to take part in physical education and organised sport through the creation of an accessible and implementable school sport support system. To drive the programme further, the SA Schools Shootout took place for six days during a three-week period in March 2012 in Johannesburg. The National Schools Sport League Programme was then launched on the 28 March 2012 in Mamelodi.
