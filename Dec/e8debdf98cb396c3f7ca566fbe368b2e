Pretoria - Live testing of the billing system for the e-toll on Gauteng's roads has been launched, the South African National Roads Agency Limited (SANRAL) announced on Friday. During this test phase, registered e-road users will be able to observe the test toll transactions on their e-toll accounts, which will be updated within 24 hours. "This will be available on the SANRAL website at www.sanral.co.za. Non-registered e-road users may receive test invoices showing their test transactions," SANRAL said. It stressed that during this test phase no funds will be deducted from motorist's e-toll accounts. "The test invoices and e-toll account updates will represent the test e-toll transactions for particular toll gantries for the specific user for the test period," SANRAL added. SANRAL encouraged motorists to register for an e-tag account, which will grant them access to discounts available to e-tag users. This includes a 48% e-tag discount, the frequent user discounts and R550 per month e-toll tariff cap available to registered motorcycles and light motor vehicles fitted with an e-tag.
