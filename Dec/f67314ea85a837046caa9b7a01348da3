Pretoria - The Hawks have arrested three Zambian nationals for transporting drugs worth R34 million into the country. The Hawks in Gauteng carried out the arrests on Saturday after following up on tip-off, Gauteng police spokeswoman Captain Pinky Tsinyane said. They pulled over and searched a truck and found a false compartment with the drugs that has an estimated street value of R34 million, she added. "The information received is that the truck was from Tanzania, it came through the Botswana Border to deliver in South Africa, Gauteng and Western Cape. The area of delivery is not known yet, investigations are continuing," Tsinyane said. Police would also try to track the owner of the truck and drugs, as well as determine if there were others involved in the operation. The three suspects are expected to appear in Randfontein Magistrate Court soon on a charge of drug trafficking.
