Pretoria - Transport Minister Sibusiso Ndebele has conveyed condolences to the family of former Director of the KwaZulu-Natal Road Traffic Inspectorate, John Schnell. Schnell, who was one of South Africa's longest serving Traffic Chiefs, passed away on Monday. "On behalf of the transport family, we wish to convey condolences to the family and colleagues of John Schnell who passed away yesterday. "John was in the employ of the state for more than 41 years until he retired in 2010, and his sheer energy astonished us. He will be sorely missed. May his soul rest in peace" he said. Ndebele said in the history of traffic law enforcement in South Africa, there had probably been numerous Traffic Chiefs' who displayed some of the law enforcement virtues of learning, wisdom, compassion, eloquence, robust independence, impartiality, attentiveness, diligence, common sense, clarity of thought and of expression, administrative skills and strength of character. "However, few have had all of these qualities and to the high level that was manifest by John Schnell. We have lost an anchor, but John will continue to be part of our professional frame of reference. "What he has given us, what he has given KwaZulu-Natal, what he has given South Africa, what he has given the international traffic law enforcement fraternity, endures far beyond his tenure in government," he said. Ndebele said Schnell left the nation with many memories, many contributions and insights, on which the nation will draw from for many years to come.
